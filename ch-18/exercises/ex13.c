/* Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that PI is a macro that represents 
 * 3.14159)
 * (a) char c = 65; -> legal char type is like short int
 * (b) static int i = 5, j = i * i; -> illegal, static only supports constant initialization
 * (c) double d = 2 * PI; -> legal
 * (d) double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2}; -> legal */
